<h1> Directives </h1>

<h3> ng-let </h3>
<p>
  *ngLet can be used to define variables in the HTML file<br>
  It's like using *ngIf without the "if" part, and more importantly without recreating the context each time.
  <br><br>
  usage:  *ngLet="(value$ | async) as val"
</p>

<div *ngLet="(value$ | async) as val"> x = {{ val }} </div>
<div *ngLet="abc as val"> x = {{ val }} </div>
